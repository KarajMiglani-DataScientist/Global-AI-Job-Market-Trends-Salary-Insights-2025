# Load the Data into SQL

Import the cleaned file into your SQL database and run analytical queries.

1. Average salary by job title:
   SELECT job_title, ROUND(AVG(salary_usd)) AS avg_salary
   FROM ai_jobs
   GROUP BY job_title
   ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

2. Salary by company location:
   SELECT company_location, ROUND(AVG(salary_usd)) AS avg_salary
   FROM ai_jobs
   GROUP BY company_location
   ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

3. Experience level distribution:
   SELECT experience_level, COUNT(*) AS total_roles
   FROM ai_jobs
   GROUP BY experience_level;

4. Remote trend analysis:
   SELECT remote_ratio, COUNT(*) AS job_count
   FROM ai_jobs
   GROUP BY remote_ratio;

5. Most in-demand skills (if using a numbers table for splitting):
SELECT TRIM(skill) AS skill, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM (
    SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(required_skills, ',', n.n), ',', -1) AS skill
    FROM ai_jobs
    JOIN numbers n ON CHAR_LENGTH(required_skills)
       - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(required_skills, ',', '')) >= n.n - 1
) AS skill_table
GROUP BY skill
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
